<b>Subject: [Partially Resolved] VPN Connection Issues and Outages</b>
<br>
<br>
Good morning folks,
<br>
<br>
We are currently experiencing some issues with VPN connectivity in the $location office and surrounding area. If you could please verify connectivity for us by accessing our temporary portal located [here]($evilurl) and letting us know the results by replying to this e-mail, it would be much appreciated.
<br>
<br>
For those of you who are still having some issues, we are working on it and hope to have these fixed by end of day.
<br>
<br>
Thanks,
<br>
<br>
