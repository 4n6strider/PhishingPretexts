<b>Subject: New information regarding the ongoing $casename case</b>
<br>
<br>
$greeting $hremployee,
<br>
<br>
I am contacting you (as well as other fellow $organization employees) regarding the ongoing $casename case, which has been going through the courts since $casedate1. As you may know, a motion to adjourn was passed on $motiondate to resume on $casedate2. In light of this, we need some help for those in positions relevant to the case in order to review some information. Most of it will likely be a bit repetitive, and we appreciate your collaboration and patience while going over the instructions below.
<br>
<br>
<ol type="1">
	<li>Access our extranet with your regular credentials: $evilurl</li>
	<li>Go over the information.</li>
	<li>Verify the information and sign your name.</li>
	<li>Report back with your comments before $date.</li>
</ol>
<br>
I'm sure you're aware that the nature of the file's contents are sensitive, and therefore ask that you please not discuss them with anyone outside of this e-mail.
<br>
<br>
Cordially,
<br>
<br>
