$greeting $firstname,

Due to a new $organization policy to save on unused licenses, we are looking to deactivate accounts which aren't being actively used. According to our logs, it seems you haven't logged in to your $organization $service account in over 30 days. If you would like to keep your existing account, please access the portal below before $date. Otherwise, there's no need to do anything else.
