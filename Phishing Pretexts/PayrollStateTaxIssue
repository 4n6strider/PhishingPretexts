<b>Subject: Verify State for Payroll Deductible</b>
<br>
<br>
$greeting $firstname,
<br>
<br>
We've been having a few issues with paystubs not showing employees' correct state for income tax deduction. This has only affected a handful of people from $organization's $department department so far, however we are being cautious with the issue and asking all employees to make the verification. If the correct state is listed, please disregard this message. Otherwise, please let me know so that myself or someone else from accounting can straighten the issue as soon as possible.
<br>
<br>
We apologize for the issues and can assure you that we are working on resolving this as fast as we can.
